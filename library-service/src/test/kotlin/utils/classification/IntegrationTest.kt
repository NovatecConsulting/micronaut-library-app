/**
 * Qualifier for Integration Tests:
 *
 * - [tagged][Tag] as `integration-test`
 * - if annotated class is a Spring Boot test:
 * -- imports [BaseTestConfiguration]
 * -- imports [IntegrationTestConfiguration]
 * -- activates profiles: `test` and `integration-test`
 * -- enables [DirtiesContext]
 *
 * An integration test is a test integrating one or more components of a
 * system. A component can be a module, a set of classes, a framework or
 * something like a database. It is allowed to fake (mock, stub etc.) parts
 * of the application in order to isolate the part you want to test.
 *
 * For this application integration tests are generally used for the outer
 * boundaries like HTTP (API), the database (persistence) and the correct
 * usage of framework features like caching, aspects, error handlers etc.
